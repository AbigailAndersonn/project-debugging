# Assignment Instructions

You'll put your debugging skills into practice along with some of the other programming skills you've acquired for this project. You will build out a calculator with some basic functions: add, subtract, multiply, and divide. As with previous assignments, when you look through the code that's provided, you'll find any lines marked with `TO DO` as a call for you to do something.

# Description of Project Files
* **.travis.yml**: do not edit this file, it is used for automated testing
* **calculator-runner.py**: this file sets up the program and runs the functions in calculator.py. You don't need to edit this file but you can take a peek, if you'd like. If you do edit, edit at your own risk!
* **calculator.py**: you'll need to edit this file, it contains some empty functions, and some comments that start with `TODO` that will detail what you need to do for full credit.
* **test_ticTacToe.py**: do not edit this file, it is used for automated testing
